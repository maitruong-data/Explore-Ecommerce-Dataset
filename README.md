# Explore-Ecommerce-Dataset
Use SQL in BigQuery to improve channel quality, cohort funnel and cross-sell

## I. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on Google BigQuery. 
**Business goals:** 
This project analyzes Google Analytics 360 e-commerce sessions to find practical levers for **growing monthly revenue**. I compare baseline performance and seasonality (visits, pageviews, transactions), with focus on July, and evaluate **channel quality** and **onsite funnel efficiency** using bounce rate, revenue per session, and the view → add-to-cart → purchase path. The analysis identifies which traffic sources to scale or fix, where users drop off, the expected AOV/upsell potential, and **cross-sell pairs** for “frequently bought together”, turning raw GA data into concrete actions for acquisition, conversion, and merchandising.

## II. DATASET
**Dataset access:**

This eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:
- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account
- Get data through:
  - this link https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2sgoogle_analytics_sample!3sga_sessions_20170801
  - Or create a new project in BigQuery -> select "Add Data" -> "Search a project" -> Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" -> "Enter" -> Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it

**Dataset description:** 

The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website. (`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801` )
The sample dataset contains obfuscated Google Analytics 360 data from the [Google Merchandise Store](https://www.googlemerchandisestore.com/shop.axd/Home?utm_source=Partners&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Data%20Share%20Promo), a real ecommerce store. The Google Merchandise Store sells Google branded merchandise. The data is typical of what you would see for an ecommerce website. 

**Data description table:**

Below are the fields, data type, description of the fields I used in this SQL project

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| fullVisitorId   | String   | The unique visitor ID     |
| date      | String     | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format      |
| totals      | Record     | This section contains aggregate values across the session      |
| totals.bounces      | Integer     | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null      |
| totals.hits      | Integer     | Total number of hits within the session      |
| totals.pageviews      | Integer     | Total number of pageviews within the session      |
| totals.visits     | Integer     | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session      |
| totals.transactions      | Integer     | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session      |
| trafficSource.source      | String     | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter      |

FROM purchaser p
FULL JOIN non_purchaser n
ON p.month = n.month
ORDER BY p.month;
Non-purchasers view far more pages than purchasers (~334 vs ~124/pageviews per user), hinting at friction or dead-ends before checkout
```

## IV. INSIGHTS
**Business goal:** Grow monthly revenue by improving channel quality, onsite funnel, and cross-sell.

**Baseline health check (January-August 2017)**

- May had highest conversion rate (1,160 txns, 1.77% conversion rate), while July had highest visits and pageviews (71.8k visits, 270k pageviews, 1.49% conversion rate). Recommend to **set a goal to lift July’s conversion rate to May’s level**.
- Cohort map funnel was consistent through the months, ~38–42% of product views add to cart and ~8–13% convert to purchase. Thus, the biggest loss was **View → Add to Cart**. Recommend to **improve product detail page**, for example, stronger CTA, size/fit guide, faster images, better navigation etc.

**July in focus**

- Revenue mainly came from **direct (~79%)** and **Google search (~20%)**
  - Recommendations:
        - Add standard query parameters to your links so analytics can attribute traffic and revenue to the right campaigns, instead of tagging them all into “(direct)”.
        - Scale search/owned demand, and either fix or downweight YouTube/m.facebook (high bounce, low revenue) with intent-matched landing pages and Revenue per Session targets.
- Non-purchasers browsed more than purchasers (~334 vs ~124 pageviews per user), signaling friction. Recommend to improve filters, breadcrumbs, and zero-results search fixes to shorten paths to cart.
- In July, a “purchasing user” bought **~4.16 times** (across the month), and each **purchasing session** averages **~$43.86** in revenue. That meant customers already showed **repeat-buy behavior** and a **basket value** just under $45.
    - Recommend to set **free shipping at ~$49–$55** (≈10–20% above $43.86) to nudge carts slightly higher without scaring buyers. Also, **launch bundles** because repeat buyers are primed to add one more complementary item, which increases attach rate (orders with a bundle/add-on) and average order value (AOV). We then can track and monitor AOV, attach rate and checkout conversion. If conversion drops, adjust the threshold or bundle pricing.
- Launch data-backed cross-sell on the *YouTube Men’s Vintage Henley*  Product Detail Page. The data shows Henley buyers often also purchase products like *Google Sunglasses*, *Women’s Vintage Hero Tee Black*, and *SPF-15 Slim & Slender Lip Balm*. Thus, surface these as *“Frequently bought together”*, reinforce in the cart, and follow up in post-purchase/email. The goal is to increase attach rate (the % of orders with an add-on) and Average order value (AOV).
- **Add checkout accelerators**, for example, guest checkout, popular payment methods, address autofill etc. **Target a +2–3 percentage points lift** in **ATC→Purchase** to compound the July gains. July already had big traffic, so turning a few more carts into orders multiplies revenue without needing more visitors.
